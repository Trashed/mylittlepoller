TODO:
- Continue working on the UI code
    - Implement CreateNewPoller component
        - This component has fields for configuring a new poller, and creates a new poller instance
        to the poller engine over HTTP POST endpoint.
- Begin implementing poller engine
    - There is main poller engine -> this is the main process
    - User can start multiple poller instances -> these are subprocesses to poller engine, running concurrently
    - Each poller instance calls its own polling and parsing logic in defined intervals
        - Fetch the predefined site (HTML) and parse it, OR query a predefined search endpoint and parse the result (HTML/JSON possibly)
